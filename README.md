# CLOUD COMPUTING MANAGEMENT PLATFORM

---

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

• Many organizations still manage cloud infrastructure and computing resources manually or through disconnected tools, leading to inefficiencies and increased operational complexity.  
The absence of a centralized cloud management platform results in several issues:

1. **Inefficient Resource Utilization:**  
   Without proper tracking and monitoring, cloud resources may remain underutilized or over-allocated.

2. **Time-Consuming Processes:**  
   Administrators and users spend unnecessary time managing deployments, configurations, and monitoring manually.

3. **Lack of Real-Time Monitoring:**  
   Without real-time performance data, system issues and bottlenecks are detected late.

4. **Limited Accessibility and Transparency:**  
   Manual systems lack flexibility for remote access, scalability, and clear billing visibility.
